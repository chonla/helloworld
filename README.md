# Hello World

This is a very simple example of printing "hello, world" in golang. The purpose of this project is not showing how to print "hello, world", but to perform an experiment of releasing go application binary using github actions.

## Project

I saw an [action](https://github.com/wangyoucao577/go-release-action) that help releasing go application binary for multiple OS and architecture. This repository is just a so-called POC of applying that.
